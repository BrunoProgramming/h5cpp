This distribution contains two packages: an c++17 template library for major linear algebra packages and a source code transformation tool that help you to generate HDF5 compound datatype descriptors from valid C/C++ include files. 

1. donwload and install HDF5 v1.10.2 from https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/
from the source tree execute.:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-build-mode=production --enable-shared --enable-static --enable-optimization=high --with-default-api-version=v110
make -j4
sudo make install

2. The compiler is based on clang 7.0 libtooling, and the latest patter matching, therefor it requires the llvm 7.0 installed from source with clang++ support. The provided make will produce 'h5cpp' source code transformation tool, which has 'include' dependency in the supplied 'h5cpp-llvm' directory. The produced standalone binary has no other dependency other than 'h5cpp-llvm' includes, you are free to install it to other similar systems without clang++ and llvm.


git clone https://git.llvm.org/git/llvm.git/
cd llvm/tools
git clone https://git.llvm.org/git/clang.git/
cd ../projects
git clone https://git.llvm.org/git/openmp.git/
git clone https://git.llvm.org/git/libcxx.git/
git clone https://git.llvm.org/git/libcxxabi.git/
cd ../../ && mkdir build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86  ../llvm
make -j4
sudo make install

then from the h5cpp source tree:

cd compiler
make
sudo make install
