Compiling arbitrary POD types to HDF file compund types with H5CPP compiler   {#link_h5cpp_compiler}
====================================================================================================

h5cpp compiler is a fully functional clang based source code transformation tool, that identifies POD C/C++ struct types referenced by 
`h5::create | h5::read | h5::write | h5::append` operators in each TU translation units and generates the necessary HDF5 data descriptions. 

What does this mean in plain English? You take some include files, and a valid c++ program file, then all you have to do to create and HDF5 dataset is 
the following: 
```c++
#include <h5cpp/core>
#include <ddl.h>       // this will be generated by h5cpp compiler
#include <h5cpp/io> 

int main() {
	h5::create<some_complicated_struct>("file.h5", "dataset_name", h5::gzip{9} | h5::chunk{512} );
	return 0;
}
```
then invoke the compiler which will create the data definitions for you:
```bash
h5cpp  struct.cpp --  -I../path/to/h5cpp-llvm  -Dddl.h
```
